In Congress, July 4, 1776

The unnimous Declrtion ov teh thirteen unitd Sttes ov Americ, When in teh Course ov humn events, it becomez necessry 4 wn peeps 2 dissolve teh politicl bns which hs connectd tehm wif notehr, n 2 ssume mong teh powers ov teh erth, teh seprte n equl stshun 2 which teh Lws ov Nture n ov Nture's God entitle tehm,  decent respect 2 teh opinionz ov mnkind requirez tht tehy shud declre teh cuses which impel tehm 2 teh seprtion.

We hold tehes truths 2 beeseses self-evident, dt ll men r cretd equl, dt tehy r endowed by der Cre2r wif certin unlienble Rights, dt mong tehes r Life, Libeesesesrty n teh pursuit ov Hppiness.--Tht 2 secure tehes rites, Govrnments r instituted mong Men, deriving der jus powers frum teh consent ov teh govrned, --Tht whenevr ny Form ov Govrnment beesesescomes destructive ov tehes ends, it iz teh Right ov teh People 2 lter or 2 bolizh it, n 2 institute nu Govrnment, lying itz foundshun on such principlez n orgnizing itz powers in such 4m, s 2 tehm shll seem most likely 2 effect der Sfety n Hppiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictte dt Govrnments long estblizhed shud not beeseses chngd 4 light n trnsient cuses; n ccordingly ll experience hth shewn, dt mnkind r mor dizposed 2 suffer, while evils r sufferble, thn 2 rite tehmselves by bolizhing teh 4ms 2 which tehy r ccus2med. But when  long trin ov buses n usurptions, pursuin invribly teh sme Object evinces  design 2 reduce tehm undr bsolute Despotizm, it iz der rite, it iz der duty, 2 throw ovf such Govrnment, n 2 provide nu Gurds 4 der future security.--Such hs beesesesen teh ptient suffernce ov tehes Colonies; n such iz no teh necessity which constrins tehm 2 lter der 4mer Systems ov Govrnment. The hiz2ry ov teh present King ov Gret Britin iz  hiz2ry ov repeted injuries n usurptions, ll hving in direct object teh estblizhment ov n bsolute Tyrnny ovr tehes Sttes. To prove thiz, let Fcts beeseses submitted 2  cnid world.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, 4 opposing wif manly firmness hims invasions on teh rights ov teh people.

He hs refused 4  long tiem, fter such dissolutions, 2 cuse otehrz 2 bees elected; whereby teh Legisltive powers, incpble ov Annihiltion, hve returned 2 teh People t lrge 4 tehir exercise; teh Stte remining in teh men tiem exposed 2 ll teh dngers ov invsion frum without, nd convulsions within.

He has plundered r seas, ravaged r Coasts, burnt r towns, an destroyd teh lives ov r people.

He iz t thiz tiem trnsporting lrge Armies ov foreign Mercenries 2 complet teh werkz ov deth, desoltion n tyrnny, lredy begun wif circumstnces ov Cruelty & perfidy scrcely prlleled in teh most brbrous ges, n 2tlly unworthy teh Hed ov  civilized ntion.
